# Biblioteca

This is an app inspired by my friend Camila's wish to track her books and movies. You can install the Beta version from the Releases page (macOS only for now).

It is a work in progress, and you can only track books for now. I'll be adding movies very soon. If you have feature requests, please create an Issue!
